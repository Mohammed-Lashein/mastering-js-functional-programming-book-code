# Chapters notes
Regarding running the code: If you have `node` installed, you can use `node <path-to-file-relative-to-your-cwd>`

## Mnemonics
The book has some nice mnemonics, so I will document them here for later reference

### Mnemonic 1
How to remember the syntax of `apply()` and `call()` methods regarding required arguments?  
=> **A** is for **A**rray, and **c** is for **c**omma (separate passed arguments)

## Chapter 1
- FP is a different way of thinking from OOP. FP focuses on *what* should be done, rather than on *how*.
- Don't fall into the trap of thinking that FP is our goal. It is just a tool that will help us write better code.

- What FP is not: 
  - FP isn't the opposite of OOP: We can use both together in an application and get the best of both worlds

An amazing quote from the book: 
> The vast majority of today's web code is written in imperative, non-functional ways, and most coders are used to that way of working
I totally agree with this sentence and github is really full of this imperative code.
