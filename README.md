# Chapters notes
Regarding running the code: If you have `node` installed, you can use `node <path-to-file-relative-to-your-cwd>`

## Mnemonics
The book has some nice mnemonics, so I will document them here for later reference

How to remember the syntax of `apply()` and `call()` methods regarding required arguments?  
=> **A** is for **A**rray, and **c** is for **c**omma (separate passed arguments)
